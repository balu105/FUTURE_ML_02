#Predicting Movie Box Office Revenue
#Overview
This project aims to predict the box office revenue of movies using various features, such as genre, cast, and production budget. The model helps to understand what factors influence a movie’s financial success.

#Skills Learned
Regression Modeling: Learn to build models that predict continuous values, like box office revenue.
Feature Engineering: Transform raw data (e.g., genres, cast) into useful features for the model.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for use in machine learning.
#Tools Used
Python: Programming language for building the model.
Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning, used to train and evaluate the model.
Matplotlib: Used for creating visualizations to analyze results.
#Dataset
TMDB Movie Dataset: A collection of movie data including genres, cast, budgets, and box office revenues.
Deliverables
Prediction Model: A machine learning model that predicts box office revenue based on movie features.
Report: A summary of key factors (like genre and budget) that affect box office revenue, along with an evaluation of model performance.
#Steps
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset and convert features into a suitable format.
Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve the model's accuracy.
Model Building: Train different regression models to predict box office revenue.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance and accuracy.
Report: Provide insights into the most important features and model results.
