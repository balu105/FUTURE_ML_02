# Predicting Movie Box Office Revenue

## Overview

This project aims to predict the box office revenue of movies based on various features, such as genre, cast, and production budget. The goal is to understand and predict a movie’s financial success using historical data.

## Skills Learned

- **Regression Modeling**: Build models to predict continuous values, specifically box office revenue.
- **Feature Engineering**: Convert raw data (such as genres, cast, etc.) into useful features for the model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the data into a suitable format for machine learning.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language used to build and train the model.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to create and evaluate the predictive model.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library used to plot graphs and analyze results.

## Dataset

- **TMDB Movie Dataset**: Contains various details about movies, including genres, cast, production budget, and box office revenue. This dataset is used to train the model.

## Deliverables

1. **Prediction Model**: A machine learning model capable of predicting box office revenue based on input features like genre, cast, and budget.
2. **Report**: A detailed report highlighting key features influencing box office revenue and an evaluation of the model’s performance.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical data (e.g., genre and cast) into numerical values.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Derive new features or modify existing ones to improve model predictions (e.g., combining genres or calculating the number of cast members).
3. **Model Building**: Train different regression models (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) to predict box office revenue.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to evaluate the model.
5. **Report**: Summarize findings, identify important features, and provide recommendations for improving the model.
